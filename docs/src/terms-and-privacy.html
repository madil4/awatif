            <h2 class="text-3xl text-gray-800 font-bold mb-5">License Agreement</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">
              The following terms and conditions apply to all agreements, contracts, and legal actions between Mohamed Elsayed (licensor) and customers (referred to as "customer"). By installing or using the software (referred to as "program(s)"),
              the customer agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this license. If the customer violates any of these restrictions, the license will automatically expire. The granted license defines the customer's rights, and it is only
              valid if the program was lawfully acquired.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl text-gray-800 font-bold mb-2">1- License Terms</h3>
            <p class="mb-5">The free-version of Awatif is strictly for personal and/or non-commercial use. The pro-version is intended for commercial purposes.</p>

            <p class="mb-5">
              The licensor grants the customer a nonassignable, nonexclusive, nontransferable right to use the acquired program(s). This right is valid for the customer's own use, the use of their employees, or the use of contract users for a
              specified period depending on the license type. A contract user refers to an individual or entity engaged to perform internal data processing services for the customer, who is not a regular employee.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-5">
              The customer may only use the program(s) for internal data processing and must not make any part of the program(s) available to third parties, except for the customer's employees and contract users for internal data processing purposes.
              Internal data processing purposes include using the program(s) for consulting services but do not include providing data processing services, acting as an application service provider, or offering batch processing services.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-5">
              Transferring the program(s) or any part thereof to a third party is not permitted without prior written notification and consent from the licensor. The software remains the property of the licensor, and no title, ownership, copyright,
              or intellectual property rights are conveyed to the customer unless explicitly granted in writing.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl text-gray-800 font-bold mb-2">2- Fees and Prices</h3>
            <p class="mb-5">New prices published in the online web-shop supersede all previous prices.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl text-gray-800 font-bold mb-2">3- Disclaimer of Warranty</h3>
            <p class="mb-5">
              To the extent permitted by applicable law, the program is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied. The licensor does not provide any warranties, including merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.
              The customer assumes all risks associated with the quality and performance of the program. If the program is defective, the customer is responsible for any necessary servicing, repair, or correction.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl text-gray-800 font-bold mb-2">4- Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p class="mb-5">
              Unless required by applicable law or agreed upon in writing, the licensor is not liable to the customer for any damages, including general, special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use or inability to use the
              program(s). This includes data loss, inaccurate data, losses incurred by the customer or third parties, or failure of the program to operate with other programs, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl text-gray-800 font-bold mb-2">5- Other Conditions</h3>
            <p class="mb-5">
              Agreement with these terms and conditions is assumed unless explicitly disagreed upon in writing. If any provision of the terms and conditions is found to be invalid or incomplete, it does not affect the validity of the remaining
              provisions. In such cases, the ineffective provision will be replaced with an appropriate and effective regulation that fulfills legal and commercial purposes, if legally possible.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl text-gray-800 font-bold mb-2">6- Final Provisions</h3>
            <p class="mb-5">
              This contract shall be governed exclusively by the laws of the Netherlands. The place of execution, jurisdiction for deliveries and payments, as well as the resolution of disputes, is Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The licensor is entitled
              to bring legal action against customers before the appropriate court of law. The parties to this contract agree that this contract and any claims arising from or in connection with this contract shall be governed by the laws of the
              Netherlands, excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
            </p>
